;;;; The Queue datatype

;;; We can remove elements form the front of a queue.  We can add elements in
;;; three ways: to the front, to the back, or ordered by some numeric score.
;;; This is done with the following enqueing functions, which make use of the
;;; following implementations of the elements:
;;;   ENQUEUE-AT-FRONT - elements are a list
;;;   ENQUEUE-AT-END   - elements are a list, with a pointer to end
;;;   ENQUEUE-BY-PRIORITY - elements are a heap, implemented as an array
;;; The best element in the queue is always in position 0.

;;; The heap implementation is taken from "Introduction to Algorithms" by
;;; Cormen, Lieserson & Rivest [CL&R], Chapter 7.  We could certainly speed
;;; up the constant factors of this implementation.  It is meant to be clear
;;; and simple and O(log n), but not super efficient.  Consider a Fibonacci
;;; heap [Page 420 CL&R] if you really have large queues to deal with.
